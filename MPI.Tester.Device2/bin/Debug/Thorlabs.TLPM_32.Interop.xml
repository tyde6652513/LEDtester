            This function initializes the instrument driver session and performs the following initialization actions:
            
            (1) Opens a session to the Default Resource Manager resource and a session to the specified device using the Resource Name.
            (2) Performs an identification query on the instrument.
            (3) Resets the instrument to a known state.
            (4) Sends initialization commands to the instrument.
            (5) Returns an instrument handle which is used to distinguish between different sessions of this instrument driver.
            
            Notes:
            (1) Each time this function is invoked a unique session is opened.
